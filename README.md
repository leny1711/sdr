# SDR - Text-First Dating Application

A Kindle-inspired dating application where users discover profiles through reading, not swiping.

## 🎯 Concept

This is a **text-first dating application** inspired by Kindle/e-ink readers:

- Users discover profiles by **reading long descriptions**
- Profiles are scrollable like book pages
- Photos are **never visible at first**
- Photos are **progressively revealed through conversation**
- Description is PRIMARY, photos are SECONDARY

### Photo Reveal System

Photos unlock through genuine conversation:
- **<10 messages**: Fully blurred, black & white
- **10-19 messages**: Lightly visible, black & white
- **20-29 messages**: Mostly visible, black & white
- **30+ messages**: Fully visible, full color

## 🎨 Design Philosophy - Kindle Style

- Off-white/beige backgrounds (#F5F4EF)

- NO bright colors, cards, shadows, gradients
- Text-first UI with large margins
- Generous line spacing
- One screen = one readable page
- Feels like **reading**, not browsing
